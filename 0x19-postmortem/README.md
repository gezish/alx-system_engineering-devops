# Postmortem

Learning how to write an Incident Report, also referred to as a Postmortem. This postmortem follows the guidelines used closely by google engineers to file reports. The report is made up of five parts, an issue summary, a timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and lastly, corrective and preventative measures. Lets review each of these parts in detail.
## Issue Summary
    _short summary (5 sentences)
    _list the duration along with start and end times (include timezone)
    _state the impact (most user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%)
    _close with root cause

## Timeline

    _list the timezone
    _covers the outage duration
    _when outage began
    _when staff was notified
    _actions, events, â€¦
    _when service was restored

## Root Cause

   _ give a detailed explanation of event
    _do not sugarcoat

## Resolution and recovery

   _ give detailed explanation of actions taken (includes times)

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

   _ itemized list of ways to prevent it from happening again
    _what can we do better next time?
